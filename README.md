# CougBites
CougBites was my group and I's application for WSU's CrimsonCode Hackathon. Our application would allow students to see and rate WSU Dining's daily dining hall options. We had 24 hours to work on this project, and while we did not finish in time, we were able to create a basic start to an Android application with Xamarin, utilizing C#.
